  <h1>Why the Horner scheme with dice?</h1>
  <h2>Why not just add up the dots?</h2>
  <p>
    This is often the first idea on how to generate random numbers.
    Unfortunately, we quickly see a bias:
  </p>
  <table class="distrib">
    <tr>
      <th></th>
      <th colspan="6">Second throw</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>First throw</th>
      <th>1</th>
      <th>2</th>
      <th>3</th>
      <th>4</th>
      <th>5</th>
      <th>6</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>6</td>
      <td>7</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>6</td>
      <td>7</td>
      <td>8</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>3</th>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>6</td>
      <td>7</td>
      <td>8</td>
      <td>9</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>4</th>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>6</td>
      <td>7</td>
      <td>8</td>
      <td>9</td>
      <td>10</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>5</th>
      <td>6</td>
      <td>7</td>
      <td>8</td>
      <td>9</td>
      <td>10</td>
      <td>11</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>6</th>
      <td>7</td>
      <td>8</td>
      <td>9</td>
      <td>10</td>
      <td>11</td>
      <td>12</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>
    More accurately, we obtain the following distribution:
  </p>
  <table class="distrib">
    <tr>
      <th>Sum</th>
      <th>Relative Frequency</th>
    </tr>
    <tr><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr>
    <tr><td>3</td><td>2</td></tr>
    <tr><td>4</td><td>3</td></tr>
    <tr><td>5</td><td>4</td></tr>
    <tr><td>6</td><td>5</td></tr>
    <tr><td>7</td><td>6</td></tr>
    <tr><td>8</td><td>5</td></tr>
    <tr><td>9</td><td>4</td></tr>
    <tr><td>10</td><td>3</td></tr>
    <tr><td>11</td><td>2</td></tr>
    <tr><td>12</td><td>1</td></tr>
  </table>
  <p>
    This means that the value 7 is six times more likely to appear than
    the value 2. That is not a uniform distribution.
  </p>
  <h2>Why not just juxtapose/concatenate the digits?</h2>
  <p>
    That does seem a bit fairer. However, the die probably only has
    sides with at least 1 and at most 6 dots, which means the digits 0,
    7, 8 and 9 will never occur.
  </p>
  <h2>So what does the Horner scheme do?</h2>
  <p>
    It takes the juxtaposition/concatenation idea and modifies it to
    make sure that there are no &#8220;impossible digits&#8221;.
  </p>
  <p>
    A juxtaposition/concatenation of a digit to the end of a number is
    the same as:
    <ul>
      <li>multiplying the number by 10</li>
      <li>adding the digit to the result of the multiplication</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Why the number 10? The reason is that we have ten different options
    that a digit can be (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9), so to ensure
    that the new digit is independent of all the digits in the previous
    number, we must &#8220;make space&#8221; for the new digit by
    multiplying the previous number by the number of options that the
    new digit can have.
  </p>
  <p>
    And that&#8217;s the whole trick, really. Since a six-sided die only
    has six options, we don&#8217;t multiply by ten before adding the
    next roll, but just by six. We also have to map the die dots (1 dot to
    6 dots) to the digit range of 0 to 5, since 6 is technically already
    the next &#8220;rank&#8221;. (If this feels puzzling, consider a
    ten-sided die with 1 to 10 dots &#8211; 10 is obviously a special
    number of dots unlike the others because it has two digits.)
  </p>
  <p>
    So all that happens is:
    <ol>
      <li>
        Map the dots on the die to the numbers 0 to <em>n</em> where
        <em>n</em> is one less than the total number of sides on the die.
      </li>
      <li>Start with the number 0.</li>
      <li>As often as necessary:</li>
      <ol>
        <li>Multiply the number by 10.</li>
        <li>Roll the die.</li>
        <li>
          Add the value corresponding to the dots on the top side of the
          die (see step 1).
        </li>
      </ol>
    </ol>
  </p>
